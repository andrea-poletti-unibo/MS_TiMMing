# MS_TiMMing
The repository provides data, code, and results from the TiMMing analysis, which focuses on the differential timing of copy number alterations (CNAs) in multiple myeloma and its precursor conditions, MGUS and SMM. This analysis employs a customized Bradley-Terry model to assess the clonality and progression of these genetic alterations.

The findings from this analysis are detailed in the publication:

Alberge J.B., Dutta A., Poletti A., et al. "Genomic landscape of multiple myeloma and its precursor conditions, and its clinical implications." 2025. Nature Genetics (in press).
